      Howdy! This website is a bit of a work in progress, so pardon the dust. I'm still learning more HTML and CSS little by little (thanks codecademy and Stack Overflow!) so apologies if this site looks a little barren. You can follow my development of this website by clicking on the "Development Notes" link below.
