    <h2>IBM Model M2 refurbishment</h2>
    <p> After months of reading about the superiority of buckling springs, and how oh
      so tactile they are supposed to be, I set off to eBay in search of the ultimate
      typing experience: The IBM Model M keyboard.
    </p>
    <h3> What actually ended up happening</h3>
    <p>Well, the Model M search didn't quite go as planned. I was oriinally in search
      of a Model M13 (Model M with a Trackpoint) but those were well out my price
      range. So, off to search for the good 'ol Model M. Except I wasn't too eager
      to spend $55 before shipping on a 25 year old keyboard filled with 25 years
      worth of boogers, Doritos, dog hair and who knows what else. So, just as
      I was about give up, I read about the Model M2 which was sorta like the Model M
      except apparently not as robust--the capacitors are known to dry out
      on these guys*. A-ha! I'll find one with broken capacitors for cheap! So back to
      eBay I went, and I stumbled upon an Model M2 with the notorious broken capacitor
      issue. $30 later, I was greeted with a Model M2 on my doorstep</p>
      </br>
    <p> *I learned in my circuits class that apparently in the late 80's, a Chinese
      capacitor manufacturer stole the design for capacitors from a Taiwanese firm,
      except they messed up some part of the design, causing the knock off capacitors
      to dry out after time. Perhaps that's what has caused many of these keyboards
      to fail</p>
    <h3> The keyboard</h3>
    <p> The keyboard wasn't actually in too terrible of a condition--the keys
      were relatively clean (for a 25 year old keyboard that is) and the plastic casing was in decent condition. Some of
      the keys felt a little spongy, while others felt heavenly:nice and heavy, up
      until the point at which the springs buckled--then a satisfying immediate drop
      in force. Wonderfully tactile. </p>

      The dirt under the keyboard though was a bit of a different story.

    <h3> The rebuild process </h3>
    <p>So, off I went with the rebuild process. First step is popping off all the
      keycaps. You'll need a tiny flathead for this.

      Flip the keyboard over and you'll find that the screws attaching the backcover
      to the front plate are squares. Fear not for a tiny flathead or a flat phillips
      head wll work here. Run a tiny flathead across the front plate and gently pry
      away the front plate from the clips holding it on. Once you get the front plate
      off, you'll be greeted with this sight:

      A wonderful taste of what is to come when putting it all back together.
      You'll have a blast./s <br>
      The clips holding the controller board are rather tight, and if you are hamfisted
      like me, you will definitely break them. On this board, you'll find two
      capacitors: a 2.2uF 50V capacitor and a 47uF 16V capacitor. <img src=""/>
      Lucky for me, the
      circuits lab at Case has a bunch of components in a back room that you can take
      for free. I used a random 16uF 50V and a 200uF 50V capacitor that I found lying
      around.
