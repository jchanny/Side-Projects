Currently: 
LinkedList stores player objects
	Player objects contain list of properties they own
	Player object stores index of location of player on board
	
Board itself is array of Tiles
	each tile stores constants & Player that owns
	
WHAT I WANT:
	-how to make it easy to figure out who is current Player
		-current position of each player is be stored in the
		Player object
