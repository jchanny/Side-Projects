Currently: 
LinkedList stores player objects
	Player objects contain list of properties they own
	Player object stores index of location of player on board
	
Board itself is array of Tiles
	each tile stores constants & Player that owns
	
WHAT I WANT:
-find a way to access PropertyTile methods
	-board[] is for Tile objects;
	the problem is when accessing board[]
	to access property data, you can only get
	Tile's methods. Cannot use PropertyTile's
	or SpecialTile's methods. 
	-current workaround is to put methods 
	that are supposed to be in PropertyTile
	into Tile
		-this isn't good for SpecialTile
